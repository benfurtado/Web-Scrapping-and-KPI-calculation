I am using python 3.9.13

Run "python3 -m venv venv" on the terminal

venv\Scripts\activate to run the virtual environment on Windows


Once inside the environment run the following on the terminal:

for the 1st problem :

python3 -m pip install requests
python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4

python3 web_scrapper.py (to run the file)

for the 2nd problem :

python3 -m pip install pandas  (reading the csv file and saving the kpi data to csv file)
python3 -m pip install mathplotlib (used for deploying the points of the graphs , creating the graphs)
python3 -m pip install fpdf (used for creating the pdf)

python3 kpi_dashboard.py (to run the file or after installing dependencies just double click on dailyrun.bat)
